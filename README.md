# Download-YouTube-Videos-or-Playlist

This program's basic aim is to download youtube videos (single/multiple) or playlist as per the user's choice.

The program initially asks the user for an input regarding what the user would like to opt for:
  - single video download: press 0
  - multiple videos download: press 1
  - playlist download: press 2
  
After this, the user has to manually enter the path to the folder where the download would be stored and this must be done in the program. A small change can be made by asking the user for the input to the path where the download would be stored. For single video and playlist, the user has to define the url but again, in the program. Here also user could be asked to input the url of the single video or playlist. In the multiple videos option, the user has to define a file name where all the youtube video links which are to be downloaded are stored. My file name is 'links_file.txt'. This file name is also supposed to be manually entered in the program. Just like before, here also the user could be asked to input the location of file from where the links could be found. 

After this, the download(s) would begin and stored in the location defined by the user.
